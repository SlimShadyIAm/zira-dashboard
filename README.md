# Zira Dashboard

This template, based off of my [Material Admin](https://github.com/SlimShadyIAm/material-admin) template, was created as a static HTML mockup for an administrative dashboard for [Zira](https://zira.ovh), a Discord bot with almost 10 million users and is in use in 57,000 guilds. The dashboard serves as a graphical way to control the bot's configuration.
